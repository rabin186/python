## My Python Learning

This is where Iâ€™m learning Python from the **CS50â€™s Introduction to Programming with Python** course by Harvard.

Iâ€™m adding my practice files, exercises, and notes here as I go through the course (although they might not look properly managed, i am doing what i can).

## What Iâ€™m Using

- Python 3
- Neovim (for coding)

## My Goal

I just want to get better at Python and understand the basics really well.
